            <p>Cats are cute, furry, four-legged animals that make the best pets. They love to cuddle and show affection to their owners. They can also be very protective and respond to an owner's emotions and health. Cats make excellent coding buddies, like to perform actions such as kneading and purring, and will be your best friend. Althougth each cat has its own personality and physical appearance, every cat on this planet is cool. As a classmate once told me in first grade, cats rule and dogs drool...or did I see that on Garfield?
